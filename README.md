# clothing-store

This is an e-commerce clothing store website I built which is responsive. It has
a lot of features including Google authentication for sign-in and sign-up, add
item to cart, Firebase for storing the user and cart item data, and integrating
payment methods with Stripe.

I built with React, Redux, React Router, Firebase, Stripe, React-bootstrap and
deploy the application on Heroku.
